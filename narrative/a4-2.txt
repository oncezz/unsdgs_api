When a country reduces its trade barrier, it can happen in different contexts. That is, it can happen unilaterally, under a multilateral platform, or as a reciprocal exchange between a small group of countries.<br><br>
Firstly, a country can cut its tariffs on its own without requiring other countries to do the same. This is called unilateral trade liberalization. This kind of liberalization allows the liberalizing country to import goods from the world at lower prices.<br><br>
Consumers enjoy cheaper goods, while producers have better access to intermediate and capital goods, although they still face the same barriers when exporting their products to the rest of the world.<br><br>
Alternatively, countries can agree to cut their trade barriers simultaneously under the World Trade Organization’s platform. This multilateral trade liberalization tends to improve efficiency among all the parties involved because each country can now focus on the industries in which it has the greatest comparative advantage. However, reaching a consensus among all WTO members can sometimes involve lengthy negotiations.<br><br>
Therefore, some countries bypass the WTO and negotiate preferential trade agreements bilaterally or regionally.<br><br>
These preferential trade agreements help countries within the bloc trade more freely with each other; this increase in trade activity is called trade creation.<br><br>
However, they also discourage the members of these agreements from trading with other countries outside of the bloc. The outsiders are then suffered from the trade diversion. While preferential trade agreements promote trade among some countries, other countries are left behind.<br><br>
Lastly, the trade policy reforms we have discussed so far focus on border measures such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers. However, many trade agreements in the 21st century begin to include more<br><br>
 behind-the-border measures such as labor standards, environmental protection, competition policy, and so on. The second half of this module will explore these behind-the-border features of the new trade agreements.<br><br>
In almost all cases, protective trade measures favor industries that cannot compete with imports at world market prices. In developing countries, these industries are typically capital-intensive, such as heavy industry and technology-intensive activities, since the rest of the world has a comparative advantage in these.<br><br>
In almost all cases, moreover, trade barriers induce inefficiencies that reduce total income.<br><br>
As a result, domestic owners of scarce resources like capital benefit from protection, while owners of resources in non-protected sectors, like agricultural land, must lose.<br><br>
It follows that tariff reductions can be expected to reverse both these effects – albeit not immediately, since adjustment may be slow and possibly costly.<br><br> 
A simulation study of unilateral tariff reductions in Brazil shows a typical pattern of changes.<br><br>
Economist Glenn Harrison and his team used a simulation model to evaluate various reform possibilities in South America, including unilateral tariff reductions. These numbers highlight the Brazilian case.<br><br>  
This graph shows simulated changes in household welfare due to the tariff reform in Brazil.  Simulation models are often used to evaluate trade policy reforms because they are capable of separating out the effects of a policy change from other changes occurring in the economy at the same time.<br><br> 
Brazil’s tariff structure strongly favored manufacturing and penalized other sectors, including agriculture. Owners of capital, therefore, were big winners from tariffs, while landowners were penalized, with labor owners fell in between. The tariff reduction raised returns to land and reduced those to capital.<br><br>
Among households, the biggest gains from reforms went to rural households and those in the bottom 40%, as well as some very wealthy rural, that is, landowning households. Poor and rural households derive most of their income from land and labor.<br><br> 
The Brazil case shows the effects of "traditional" trade reform. "Traditional" trade policy reforms focus almost exclusively on reducing barriers to trade that occur "at the border" – that is, tariffs and non-tariff barriers, and other measures that inhibit the free flow of goods and services across international borders.<br><br>
Tariff reform has profound effects on any economy - and especially on smaller economies since their domestic prices must fully adjust to international market prices as trade becomes more open. As we have seen, these effects alter household incomes - and also government budgets. Changes in household incomes, in turn, affect private spending on items, such as health and education, that are the targets of several of the social and economic SDGs.<br><br>
Household decisions are crucial to progress on many economic and social SDGs. Education, nutrition, and health are key examples of these. As household incomes increase, spending on these typically rises. The graph illustrates with a comparison of household spending - as a percentage of total spending - on education by quintile of the household income distribution. Households in the lowest income group spend less than 1% on education; those in the richest group spend three times more.<br><br>
In other words, raising household incomes will decrease the need for special policies addressing these SDG targets. The lesson here is that trade policy reforms, by increasing total income and to the extent that they redistribute gains towards poorer households, can be complementary with the efforts to achieve the SDGs.
