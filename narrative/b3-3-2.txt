How can trade promote responsible consumption and production?<br><br>
Demands for sustainable products are largely driven by consumer awareness. Consumers are willing to pay a little more if they know that the product comes from a sustainable source.<br><br>
Governments, particularly in developed countries, also design their regulations to reflect such consumer preferences. Those regulations apply to both domestically-produced and imported products and thus influence the behavior of exporters in other countries as well.<br><br>
Beyond individuals and national governments, some modern-day trade agreements contain behind-the-border provisions that promote sustainable practices.<br><br>
Lastly, some environment-friendly products, such as electric cars, require advanced technology to produce. Free trade enables consumers in developing countries to access these products.<br><br>
Consumers’ choices can make an impact in the market.<br><br>
A study in 2011 found that frozen Alaska pollock sold in the United Kingdom has a price premium of 14% if it has the Marine Stewardship Council certification.<br><br>
Another study in 2004 estimated that consumers in the United Kingdom are willing to pay 11% more for coffee with the Fair-Trade label.<br><br>
Similarly, another study in 2007 found that consumers are willing to tolerate up to a 20% increase in price if a product has a label saying that it is made under good labor conditions.<br><br>
The demand for sustainable products from conscious consumers can lead to responses from exporters. For example, the Ecuadorian government has introduced reforms to ensure the sustainability of their seafood and cocoa exports. On the other hand, exporters that bear a poor sustainability image might receive adverse reactions from consumers in certain markets, as we will see in the next slide.<br><br>
Indonesia is the world’s largest exporter of palm oil, and palm oil is the second most exported product of the country. Exports grew from 1 million tons in 1990 to 26 million tons in 2019.<br><br>
However, Indonesia’s forest area also declined from 119 million hectares to 93 million hectares over the same period as forest lands were converted to plantations. The expansion of oil palm plantations is one of the major causes of deforestation and has raised concerns among environmental activists in many countries.<br><br>
The negative image of palm oil can also be observed through the reduction of palm oil consumption in some countries. This figure shows the quantity of oil & fat imported into Germany from 2015 to 2019. We can see that the quantities and the shares of palm and palm kernel oil have declined over that time.<br><br>
Besides consumer preferences, governments can also use regulations as a non-tariff measure to enforce more responsible production.<br><br>
For example, The European Union enacted the RoHS and WEEE regulations in 2003. RoHS restricts the use of hazardous substances, such as lead, mercury, cadmium, in electrical and electronic products, while WEEE governs the collection and recycling of electrical & electronic equipment wastes.<br><br>
Another similar regulation enacted in 2007 is REACH, which mandates that chemicals produced in or imported to the European Union must be registered and evaluated for risk and toxicity. Uses of substances of very high concern may also be restricted or require special authorization.<br><br>
To retain access to the EU markets, developing countries such as China, Thailand, and Viet Nam also adopt domestic regulations that comply with RoHS and REACH.<br><br>
One study using data from Vietnamese firms found that firms that participate in the global value chain are 16% more likely to comply with chemical management requirements under REACH and RoHS.<br><br>
 Conversely, another study using data from firms in Malaysia and Vietnam found that compliance with RoHS and REACH increases exports by those firms to the EU.<br><br>
Lastly, a study using survey results on Thailand’s firms shows that compliance with these regulations is driven by the demand from the customers in the EU market.<br><br>
The same principle applies to the palm oil example we discussed earlier. This table shows the percentage of palm oil production that conforms to the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil or RSPO's practices. The largest palm-oil-producing countries, Indonesia and Malaysia, sell a significant fraction of their output to the EU, where pressures for sustainable practices are strong. The share of their output certified as sustainable under the RSPO conventions is also high. On the other hand, Thailand's exports are almost entirely to developing countries where demand for such practices is low.<br><br>
Besides the standards that are explicitly required to enter the market, trade also incentivizes exporters to adopt voluntary standards.<br><br>
 A recent paper suggests that firms in East and Southeast Asia adopt GLOBAL G.A.P., which is a private standard for agricultural products, to improve their market access to Europe.<br><br>
Similarly, another study using firm-level surveys found that exporting firms in Malaysia are more likely to adopt the ISO 14001 standard than non-exporting firms. ISO 14001 sets out the criteria for an environmental management system and maps out a framework that a company or organization can follow to set up an effective environmental management system.<br><br>
Lastly, a study in 2011 found that ISO 14001 encourages Japanese firms to adopt voluntary environment practices such as green supply chain management.<br><br>
In addition to domestic regulations, countries can also promote sustainable consumption and production through trade agreements. This slide shows some articles from the environment chapter of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP that are related to responsible production and consumption. They require the member states to follow the obligations in various international conventions as well as promote cooperation in environmentally-related areas. Parties to the agreement must comply with these provisions or risk going through the dispute settlement process, which may result in the suspension of benefits from the agreement or payment of monetary compensation for violations.
