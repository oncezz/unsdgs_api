Trade agreements between or among countries are primarily oriented to lowering barriers that inhibit trade at the border such as tariffs and non-tariff measures. The result is greater opportunity for specialization and gains from trade, as seen in the core principle of comparative advantage in Module A.2.<br><br>
The Brazil case clearly shows gains to poorer households through the labour market and land returns channels.<br><br>
These gains lower the costs of achieving economic and social SDGs. However, we also know that increasing agricultural production incentives contributed to deforestation, a change that adversely affects other SDGs.<br><br>
Capturing the gains from more open trade without inducing environmental damages is an example of the two targets two policies problem identified in earlier modules.<br><br>
More recently, the scope of international trade agreements has expanded to try to cover multiple targets. Increasingly, they include so called “behind the border” provisions—that is, agreements for reform of domestic policy settings that influence resource allocation, spending patterns, and the profitability of firms and investments that feed into international trade. An easy example of behind the border measures is rules about capital subsidies to domestic firms or laws about labour standards, each of which may impact the profitability and international competitiveness of these firms.<br><br>
These so called next generation trade agreements, including behind the border provisions, have additional and direct impacts on SDG targets. In addition to raising incomes through the same channels as traditional trade reforms, many new agreements also spell out conditions for labour, environment, and other practices that strive for harmony with the SDGs.<br><br>
These agreements, by adding additional conditions, thus have the potential to achieve more than one goal: income growth and specific SDG targets.<br><br>
This table summarizes changes that have occurred in the shift from old to new style trade agreements. Worldwide, the number of agreements was about the same in each of the 5 year periods shown. But the terms of the agreements changed a lot, as illustrated by the proliferation of chapters covering labour and environmental conditions.<br><br>
The chapters of the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP ratified in 2018 by 11 Asia-Pacific economies illustrate the range of behind the border measures that have become common in regional trade agreements. The highlighted chapters are the ones that involve activities that mostly happen behind each of the party members’ borders. Many of these are focused directly on outcomes that are shared with the SDGs. Others, however, may have contradictory or ambiguous effects.<br><br>
Many modern trade agreements include labour provisions. The labour chapters in trade agreements primarily ratify the international labour standards and prohibit the derogation of labour laws to gain an undue advantage in labour costs. A violation of these provisions can lead to a suspension of benefits from the trade agreements or other retaliatory measures. For example, in 2020, the EU suspended Cambodia’s EBA benefits due to human rights and labour rights violations.<br><br>
A negative view of these provisions is that they create a hidden form of protection for rich countries by raising labour costs in developing countries. A positive view is that they substitute for institutional failures by extending protections to vulnerable workers such as women and children. In other words, labour chapters may lower the cost of reaching decent work targets.<br><br>
Similar glass half full, glass half empty debates apply to environmental provisions in new trade deals. On balance, these probably do more to protect vulnerable natural resources and thus promote more sustainable production patterns. In other words, they are manifestations of consumer side “technique effects,” as discussed in Module A.3.<br><br>
Environmental provisions often encourage or require accession to multilateral environmental agreements. The Montreal Protocol covering ozone-depleting chemical pollutants, CITES protecting endangered species, and MARPOL, which covers emissions by international shipping, are examples of conventions to which parties to a trade deal may be required to accede. Some agreements also promote the trade of environmentally friendly products as well as other cooperation in trade related environmental issues. These protections may lower the cost of reaching the environment and sustainability SDG targets.<br><br>
Behind the border measures also extend to protections for intellectual property rights. These provisions ensure that parties to the agreement have intellectual property rights protection measures that, at least, meet the international standard set by the TRIPS Agreement of the WTO. Some agreements also extend the protection beyond that level.<br><br>
The obvious benefit of this is that better intellectual property rights encourage innovation, which is itself an SDG target. On the other hand, intellectual property rights that cover some pharmaceuticals are often argued to run counter to other SDGs, notably target 3.8, which calls for increased access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable essential medicines.<br><br>
Still, other behind the border provisions affect domestic commercial policy and consumer rights. These measures may aim to make regulatory processes both more transparent and more equitable, and the benefits of such reforms may be felt quite broadly in the form of improved confidence and trust in the business governance system. In this way, new trade deals may advance some SDGs that would not otherwise be seen as directly affected by trade.
