If trade promotes aggregate growth and firms' profitability, does it also contribute to improved human well-being?<br><br>

SDG eight, "Decent work and economic growth," aims to promote "sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all." Among its targets are productivity growth, full employment, entrepreneurship, and the promotion of decent work and protection of labour rights and safe and secure working environments.<br><br> 

The case of the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh provides a compelling lesson in how gains from trade support inclusive growth.<br><br>
It is well known that Bangladesh has experienced a huge boom in the production and export of ready-made garments. In less than 20 years up to 2018, Bangladesh's share of global ready-made garment exports increased from zero to over 6%, becoming a 40-billion dollar industry. Features of this growth included substantial trade liberalization measures, both domestic through lower tariffs on intermediate goods - and external through lower importing country's tariffs on exports from Bangladesh. In the next slides, we explore details of these changes and their implications.<br><br>
From about 1990, Bangladesh's economy was opened to trade after having been protected by prohibitively high tariffs since independence. In particular, tariffs on unfinished textiles, which are inputs to ready-made garment production, were greatly reduced. This created the conditions for rapid and profitable ready-made garment sector growth.<br><br>
The growth of the ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh has been the leading cause of the expansion of formal sector employment. Also, job creation in ready-made garment industries has spilt over to many other urban sectors such as construction, housing services, and personal services. Accompanying this spectacular growth, the share of Bangladesh's population counted as fallen below the most conservative international poverty line - fell from 44% at the start of the trade reform era to under 15% by 2016.<br><br>
A number of studies have investigated causal linkages between the growth of the ready-made garment sector and the decline in povertyâ€”along with other indicators of inclusive growth. A 2020 study found that in districts with higher exposure to the ready-made garment industries, wages and employment both increased faster than in other districts, and wages for lower-skill workers rose by more than those for higher-skill workers. These are all positive indicators of inclusive growth.<br><br>

The same study finds that over the longer run, these gains in wages and employment were spread across a larger geographical area as workers in other districts moved to take advantage of new opportunities in the faster-growing areas.<br><br>
The success of Bangladesh's ready-made garment industry has been especially beneficial for women. The male-female wage gap has declined, and several studies confirm other changes reflecting increased female empowerment through higher labour force participation and greater economic autonomy.<br><br>

Bangladesh's experience tells us that although there are still many obstacles to success and many problems to overcome, there is yet clear evidence that opening to trade created fertile grounds not only for aggregate income growth but for a form of growth that strongly favours the initially poorer households and women.<br><br>
