Hello and welcome back to the online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
In this module we ask: Does trade lower labour standards?<br><br>
This module has four components focusing on trade and decent work. It begins with an introduction of decent work and labour standards. Then, we discuss the labour market consequences of international trade. We examine how trade improves workers’ quality of life through higher wages— and increases incentives for labour exploitation at the same time. We end this module by discussing the role of domestic and international institutions in mitigating the undesired effects of trade. This module will focus on two Sustainable Development Goals: Goal 8 - Decent work and economic growth and Goal 9 - Industry, innovation, and infrastructure.<br><br>
