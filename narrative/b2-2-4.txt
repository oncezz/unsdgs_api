Many of those individuals whose wellbeing will be measured in 2030, the year in which most of the Sustainable Development Goal targets are expected to be met, are as yet unborn or are still quite small children. Policies addressing the wellbeing of current generations are worth more if they also secure the transmission of gains from parents to their children. Intergenerational mobility is the term we use to refer to this transmission of economic and social circumstances across generations.<br><br> 

Wealthy households bequeath “dynastic advantages” to their children: good health, abundant resources, network connections, and so on. Children of poor households also inherit from their parents, but they inherit deprivation. Higher intergenerational mobility—especially among poor and lower-income households—is a vital sign of inclusive growth and reduced inequality.<br><br>
Panel studies of intergenerational transmission of economic circumstances are rare in the developing world because the data requirements are very demanding. Education is easier to measure than income and is highly correlated with it. So many studies use parent-child educational correspondences in place of income when evaluating the degree of intergenerational mobility.<br><br> 

These data from Bangladesh illustrate that the propensity for children to inherit their educational achievements from parents is very high. These data show that among adult sons of fathers with no schooling, only 14% go beyond primary school. While among sons of fathers with up to primary education, that is, the first three columns, just 36% go to grade 9 or higher. This demonstrates a very strong persistence of educational attainment across generations.<br><br>
This early study from Brazil shows the earnings of sons by the education of their fathers. At age 35, the son of a father with 4-7 years of schooling earns, on average, 2.5 times more than the son of a father with zero years of education. And, the son of a father who has completed high school, that is, 11 or more years of education, earns 6 times more. Education is very highly correlated with income, so these data illustrate the importance of parental economic circumstances as influences over the fortunes of their children.<br><br> 

In general, intergenerational mobility is low in highly unequal societies and in economies with few opportunities for occupational or sectoral mobility.<br><br>
Another recent study in India compares fathers and sons over occupations ranked by educational intensity. These data also underline very low mobility at both the bottom and the top of the income distribution. Children of poor households inherit poverty from their parents, while children of wealthy households inherit wealth and opportunity.<br><br>
If intergenerational mobility is such a difficult issue, how is it affected by trade? There are three primary pathways.<br><br> 

The first pathway is through increases in income because these relax constraints on household spending for health, nutrition, and education.<br><br> 

Second, trade affects incentives for children to acquire more education than their parents. Here, as we have already seen, there is some ambiguity about the effects of trade.<br>

Third, economies that are diversifying away from agriculture into industry and services offer job market entrants a wider array of employment possibilities. Studies in wealthy countries indicate that Intergenerational mobility is lowest among households in which the children follow their parents into the same sector and occupation. Recent work in India shows that trade liberalization increases intergenerational occupational mobility, which was very low before the reforms, as we saw a few slides back.<br><br>

In developing countries, labor mobility enables children to move away from agriculture and rural areas into urban and industrial labor markets, where wages are typically much higher and opportunities are also more diverse.<br><br>
The benefits of trade for intergenerational mobility can be very indirect. In Bangladesh, an experimental intervention offering subsidies to migrate facilitated movement to non-farm jobs during the “hungry season” or the off-season for agriculture. The existence of rewarding non-farm opportunities is key to the success of that migration effort.<br><br> 

In Kenya, early childhood cognitive ability, as measured by standardized tests in primary school, predicts the propensity for individuals to migrate from rural to urban areas. The urban-rural wage gap is very large. So a “good start in life” for rural children, coupled with non-farm, urban-based opportunities for employment, can greatly facilitate intergenerational mobility.  In countries where trade-based growth is mainly in urban areas, including industrial zones near seaports, individuals with a better start in life are more readily able to move to opportunity.<br><br> 

Both these examples reiterate that trade alone is not a panacea but that trade plus other interventions that increase labor mobility can help increase intergenerational mobility.<br><br>
