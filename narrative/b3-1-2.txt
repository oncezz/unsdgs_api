Sustainable Development Goal 8 promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all. In this module, we concentrate on full and productive employment and decent work.<br><br> 

Decent work is an agenda of the International Labour Organization or ILO. In their words, Decent Work involves opportunities for work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration, freedom for people to express their concerns, organize and participate in the decisions that affect their lives and equality of opportunity and treatment for all women and men.<br><br>
The ILO also recognizes the relationship between globalization and decent work. In its 2004 report titled “Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All,” it reaffirms the importance of globalization in creating wealth and economic opportunities. However, the lack of social institutions needed to regulate economic growth means that the benefits from globalization may not always be equally shared. The goal of decent work is not assured if institutions are not supportive.<br><br> 

To that end, the ILO member states adopted the Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization in 2008. The declaration reaffirms member states’ responsibility to develop their domestic policies in accordance with the Decent Work Agenda as well as to promote international cooperation in this aspect.<br><br>
International labour standards are legal instruments that regulate ILO member states regarding the basic rights of workers. The ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work of 1998 establishes four of these principles and rights. These are freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour; the effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation. These core principles are also incorporated in Sustainable Development Goal 8.<br><br>
