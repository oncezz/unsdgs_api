In conclusion, we have seen that consumers can choose to buy more sustainable products,<br><br>
and international trade can be the channel to translate their choices into producers' actions.<br><br>
On the other hand, trade also brings some undesirable effects.<br><br>
Increased pollution is a by-product of increased economic activity, and that might require technological solutions to overcome.<br><br>
Nonetheless, there are policy instruments that can address the issues, like in the cases of palm oil or plastic wastes.<br><br>
Governments can help consumers make better decisions by raising awareness and by making the origins of each product transparent and traceable. Transparent access to information and clear-cut regulations also prevent firms from "greenwashing," that is, presenting their products as environmental-friendly in a misleading way. Governments can also collaborate with each other to attain better regulatory coherence via trade policies and other cooperative channels. However, we should keep in mind that trade policies should not be used as a disguised trade barrier. Adhering to international standards instead of unilaterally setting an arbitrary rule is one way to minimize trade interference.
