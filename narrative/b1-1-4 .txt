This module contains three very clear lessons.<br><br>

International trade and FDI augment both the value and the stocks of resources needed to improve income.<br><br>
The effects of trade and FDI on the poor are mediated by institutions (such as labour mobility) that limit access to economic resources.<br><br>
Increased economic resources plus access by the poor can greatly reduce the cost of reducing poverty.<br><br>
 
But there may be a conflict with other growth and equity objectives such as education. Trade alone may not solve this; complementary measures are needed.<br><br>
