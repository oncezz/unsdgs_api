As we saw in an earlier module, increases in productivity are at the heart of almost every important account of the links between trade and economic growth. In this module, we explore the trade-productivity relationship in more detail. But first, what do we mean by productivity growth? There are two key measures.<br><br>
First, Total factor productivity growth. This refers to an increase in output in value terms that can be produced with a given set of productive resources such as capital, labor, skills, and land. If we can produce more output, in dollar terms, without increasing the quantities of these inputs, then we attribute the increase to greater productivity.<br><br>
In reality, this increase may come in several different forms. It may be from innovations such as R&D discoveries or the acquisition of new technologies. It may come from process innovations such as economies of scale or learning by doing in industrial processes. Alternatively, it may come from inter-firm or inter-sector reallocation, such as moving resources from an inefficient firm to a more efficient one.<br><br> 

Whatever the source, when we observe an increase in the total value of all goods and services produced in the economy from the same set of inputs, we call this total factor productivity growth. Aggregate total factor productivity growth is the sum of intra-sector or intra-firm innovations plus inter-sector or inter-firm resource reallocations.<br><br> 

Developing-country data show that while innovations at the firm level can be important, it is inter-sectoral resource reallocation that really is the primary source of productivity increase. As we shall soon see, trade can play a significant role in promoting this.<br><br>
A second vital sign of productivity growth is improvements in the value of output per worker - or labor productivity.<br><br>
Labor productivity is a key determinant of wages and incomes - just think about the difference in earnings between someone with an engineering degree and someone with only primary education. But education is not the only source of labor productivity differences. Capital investment - that is, providing workers with better tools - is another way, as is the reorganization of activities to make better use of existing labor and capital. Finally, labor productivity is improved when workers move from less to more productive industries or firms. This is where trade has its most direct impact. When countries trade, they specialize in the activities that they do best. By moving labor into those activities and allowing employment to decline in activities that other countries do better, its productivity is increased.<br><br>
