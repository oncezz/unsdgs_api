Welcome back to our online course, Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
This is the second of four introductory modules titled Understanding trade: concepts and tools.<br><br>
The main goal of this module is to introduce the concepts and principles necessary to understand the relationship between trade and economic development. We will see some key concepts and principles that help put structure onto the mechanisms by which trade promotes economic growth and employment.<br><br>
We will do this mainly with reference to Goals 1-5, highlighted here. That is the goal of ending poverty, ending hunger, promoting good health and wellbeing, quality education, and gender equality.<br><br>
We will also discuss the controversial relationship between trade and inequality addressed in goal 10.<br><br> 
Finally, we will take note of some relevant and recent trends in developing country trade.<br><br>
Whereas in the previous module, we looked at trade and trade outcomes in a very general way, we now build a more specific set of tools that can be applied in a wide range of circumstances. These allow us to go deeper into the economic aspects of international trade by applying some concepts and principles that put structure on the relationship between trade and economic development.<br><br>
