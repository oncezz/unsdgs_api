At the start of this module we noticed that the SDGs contain only a few direct references to trade. Rather, trade is identified as a “means of implementation” alongside finance, technology and others. Is more direct attention justified?<br><br>
Because of the increasing magnitude of trade and its pervasive economic effects, the claim that international trade can support sustainable development is often repeated.<br><br>
 The statement from the WTO at the UN high-level political forum in 2016  that “Trade is recognized as an engine for inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction that contributes to the promotion of sustainable development”  is another representation of this view.<br><br>
Skepticism about the influence of trade is surprising since we know beyond a doubt that in every developing country, trade plays an integral role in promoting the growth of national income, determining the structure of production and employment, and influencing the distribution of income. Therefore, trade is linked to the SDGs in very many ways. The next few slides provide a general overview. In the remainder of the course we explore trade-SDG links in much more detail.<br><br>
We can disagree about the overall importance of trade but there is no doubt about the trend.<br><br>
In the past half-century, average trade intensity in the developing world (the sum of exports plus imports over GDP) has risen from about 20% to over 50%. Two generations ago, there were a great many people whose lives were effectively untouched by international influences. Now, such conditions are exceptional.<br><br>
During those years, it is found that economies that trade experience substantial increases in overall growth.<br><br>
Another important insight is that the effects of trade (and FDI) on specific SDG targets are most often indirect and may be difficult to capture for measurement purposes.<br><br>
But the aggregate impact of trade on income is without doubt its most important effect. When aggregate and household incomes grow, the cost of reaching many SDG targets is made much lower. This is a benefit enjoyed by countries that engage with the global trading system, and passed up, to their own detriment, by those that step back from trade.<br><br>
The illustration of night lights in the two Koreas brings this into sharp focus. We know that night light intensity is strongly correlated with income. The difference in intensity shows clearly how great a difference policies on either side of a border can make.<br><br>
Growth of a country’s national income (GDP) is the single most important influence on trends in the well-being of its inhabitants, and certainly the biggest single contributor to poverty reduction. When we consider the factors that are responsible for accelerations of GDP growth, opening to international trade is almost certainly the strongest and most widely shared single influence.<br><br>
This graph shows that in the 15 years after 1990, when many countries adopted more open trade policies, the GDP growth rate differential between liberalizers and non-liberalizers contributed to a cumulative 15-20 percentage point difference in total income.
