Hello and welcome to another module of our online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
In this module, we turn attention to the market and trade-related aspects of sustainability.<br><br>
This module will discuss gains from trade mainly from a consumer perspective, looking at consumersâ€™ roles in creating more sustainable trade patterns and influencing how products are produced and supplied. We will touch on issues surrounding consumer activism and their potential effects. We will also look at issues associated with voluntary and forced trade standards applied to international supply chains. These topics are concerned with Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible production and consumption.<br><br>
Sustainable Development Goal 12 aims to promote sustainable patterns of consumption and production. Among other things, it promotes the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, environmentally sound management of chemicals and all wastes, sustainable practices in both private and public sectors, and information and awareness for a sustainable lifestyle. In this module, we will discuss how international trade may help or hinder these goals.
