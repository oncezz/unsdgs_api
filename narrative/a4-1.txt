Welcome back to our online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
This is the last of four introductory modules titled Trade policy reforms and the SDGs.<br><br>
Just as trade has pervasive effects, it follows that trade policies have equally broad influence, whether on economic, social, or environmental SDGs. Just as seen in the previous module, trade can affect both the scale of economic activity and also its composition, and the two effects need not have a compatible influence on the Sustainable Development Goal targets.<br><br>
In this module, we have two objectives. First, we explore ways in which trade policy reforms interact with efforts to achieve SDGs. This module focuses on the economic and social SDGs as examples, but the lessons apply to all SDGs. As signalled in the previous modules, we will find that influence is neither completely direct nor unambiguously positive. Often, additional policies will be required to ensure that trade policy reforms do not impede progress on SDGs.<br><br>
This leads to the second objective of the module. Many 21st century trade agreements include far-reaching “behind the border” provisions in an effort to minimize adverse effects while still maximizing gains from trade. This discussion will set the stage for deeper explorations in several subsequent modules.<br><br>
