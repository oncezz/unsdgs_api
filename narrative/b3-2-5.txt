Productivity growth sustains income growth, which lowers the cost of achieving many social and economic Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>

Direct innovation via domestic R&D plays a small role in most developing countries: it is costly and risky, and there are many international substitutes.<br><br> 

Indirect innovation through resource reallocation induced by trade and FDI is more important in empirical studies. Trade is a key driver of resource reallocation, both among sectors and between less and more productive firms.<br><br> 

The historical contribution of indirect productivity gains to growth means there is a strong complementarity between trade and Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
