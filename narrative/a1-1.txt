Hello and welcome to the online training "Trade and the sustainable development goals". In this course, we will learn about ways in which trade and trade policy interact with efforts to achieve the sustainable development.<br>
The sustainable development goals were adopted by all UN member states in 2015. They are intended as "a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all."<br>
They consist of 17 integrated goals to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030. Under these goals there are a total of 169 implementable targets. Most of these are meant to be achieved by 2030 (some sooner, some later).<br>
The UN Resolution titled “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” describes itself as a “plan of action for people, planet and prosperity.“ The SDGs, it declares, “seek to build on the Millennium Development Goals and complete what they did not achieve … The Goals and targets will stimulate action over the next 15 years in areas of critical importance for humanity and the planet.”<br>
The 17 SDGs and their 169 targets are an agenda for “achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions—economic, social and environmental—in a balanced and integrated manner”<br>
Many of the 169 targets identify specific metrics of human and environmental well-being, with the intent that by striving to reach these, we improve the world’s chances of inclusive and sustainable economic development.<br>
You can visit the official SDGs website for a complete list of all 17 goals and their respective targets.
