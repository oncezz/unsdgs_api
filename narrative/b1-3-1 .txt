Hello and welcome back to the online course on Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
In this module, we focus on the mechanics of the trade-growth relationship, with special emphasis on the Sustainable Development Goal aim of inclusive growth.<br><br>
This module will begin with an introduction to the main ideas and facts linking trade with economic growth. It will then continue to consider the particular features and evidence of inclusive growth. It will highlight both potentially positive and negative trade effects on inclusive growth. The main focus of this module will be a set of economic and social SDGs, namely ending poverty, maintaining good health and quality education, gender equality, decent work and economic growth, and reducing inequalities.<br><br>
In examining the trade-growth relationship, we begin by identifying both correlations and causal factors. Correlations may hint at a relationship, but to make a causal statement, such as “trade leads to growth,” requires more evidence. We also distinguish level changes from dynamics; level changes are essentially one-time changes, for example, when an economy moves from completely closed to being open to trade. This may cause a one-time growth benefit but will not likely be continued once completed. Dynamic changes are associated with sustained growth over the longer run. Lastly, we summarize the possible positive and negative effects with respect to inclusive growth.<br><br>
