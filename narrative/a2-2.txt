All formal economic analysis, whether positive or normative that is, whether descriptive<br><br>
or prescriptive, is built from a small set of core principles.<br><br>
These include, for example, the cost-benefit principle, which says that an action should<br><br> 
be taken if and only if the additional benefits exceed the additional costs.<br><br>
Measuring costs involves the concept of opportunity cost; we will begin by discussing this<br><br> 
concept in detail shortly.<br><br>
In trade, the most salient economic principle is that of comparative advantage. We’ll talk<br><br> 
about that and its meaning for an economy.<br><br>
In the choice of policies to achieve goals such as the SDGs, the principle of increasing<br><br> 
opportunity cost is especially relevant. We’ll discuss that also in a few minutes.<br><br>
We begin with opportunity cost. Every action requires a sacrifice of some sort, even if that<br><br> 
sacrifice cannot always be easily quantified. The concept of Opportunity Cost captures this<br><br> 
fact. Opportunity cost takes account not merely of explicit costs, that is, dollar costs, but<br><br> 
also implicit costs that arise from the need to choose the activities to which scarce resources<br><br> 
(including time) are applied.<br><br>
Countries have limited resource endowments, and every production activity consumes some<br><br> 
of them — including, for example, labor hours. The opportunity cost of producing, say,<br><br> 
automobiles, is the value of the bundle of goods and services that might have been produced<br><br> 
if the decision were to made to produce no automobiles and the resources were instead allocated<br><br> 
to the next most rewarding activity.<br><br>
The old adage that there is ”no such thing as a free lunch” captures this insight.<br><br> 
Opportunity cost is a concept that underpins nearly every decision taken on<br><br> 
economic grounds, as we shall shortly see.<br><br>
“Do what you do. Do well” is the title of a 1964 song by American singer Ned Miller.<br><br> 
The intuition is that to maximize your enjoyment of life, you should devote your<br><br> 
time to activities that are the most rewarding to you.<br><br>
All production activities require resources such as the services of labor, capital, and skills.<br><br>
Because countries differ in their endowments of these resources as well as the technologies used in production,<br><br>
they each produce a given good or service at a different opportunity cost as measured by the quantity of other goods and services<br><br>
that must be sacrificed in order to produce another unit of this one.<br><br>
Without trade, countries will have to produce everything they consume domestically,<br><br> 
including products that are expensive, in terms of opportunity costs, for them to produce.<br><br>
The principle of comparative advantage says that all countries gain when they specialize in the production of goods and services requiring relatively fewer domestic resources<br><br>
and exchange those with other countries for whom different resource endowments or technologies imply different costs of production.<br><br>
The practical implication is that just by engaging in trade, countries can increase their income even without any increase in their resource endowments. Trade provides an opportunity to reassign resources to more rewarding activities, both for consumption at home and also for export, and to rely on other countries to produce and export those things we don’t do so well.<br><br> 
This insight leads naturally to the second core principle, one that guides the choice of means to achieve a selected goal. This is the principle of increasing opportunity cost.<br><br>
The principle of increasing opportunity cost says we should always seek the least-cost means to achieve a given goal (for this reason, it is sometimes called the ”low-hanging fruit rule”).<br><br> 
In searching for solutions to poverty and deprivation, trade offers numerous possibilities at low or even negative costs (negative, because trade is associated with other benefits as well).<br><br>
In this series, we explore the very real possibility that trade can lower the effective cost of achieving progress toward the SDGs. For example, if trade contributes to income growth, then the bill for explicit anti-poverty policies and programs will go down accordingly.<br><br>
Of course, this isn’t always the case, so we also have the important task of identifying cases in which trade is either complementary or contradictory to sustainable development goals. Often, contradictions will turn out to be associated with institutions or policies that reduce or inhibit the achievement of gains from trade. We’ll come to that issue soon.
