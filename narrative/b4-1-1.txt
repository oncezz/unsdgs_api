Hello and welcome back to the next module of our online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br> 
In this module, we turn our attention to institutions and international collaborations that can help advance the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>
This module addresses the role that better institutions and international collaborations can have in influencing trade patterns and their outcomes. It will highlight key initiatives coming out of the World Trade Organization, provisions in trade agreements as well as initiatives by international organizations, such as the OECDâ€™s Aid-for-Trade initiative. This module will focus on Sustainable Development Goals 16 and 17.<br><br>
Sustainable Development Goal 16 promotes peaceful and inclusive societies, provides access to justice for all, and builds effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions. Its targets involve domestic institutional matters such as promoting the rule of law, reducing corruption, developing transparency, strengthening the participation of developing countries in global governance, and ensuring fundamental freedoms.<br><br> 

Sustainable Development Goal 17 aims to strengthen the global partnership for sustainable development. Its targets include measures to strengthen the rule-based multilateral trading system, mobilize financial resources for developing countries, promote foreign direct investment, enhance policy coherence, and support capacity building.<br><br>
We begin our discussion with the relationship between international trade and domestic institutions, which are the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 16. We then move on to topics in Sustainable Development Goal 17, beginning with rule-based multilateral trading under the World Trade Organization. We will also discuss the role of the WTO as the dispute settlement body and its capacity-building initiative - Aid for Trade. We will end this module by talking about the so-called next-generation trade agreements that go beyond the scope of the WTO and how those agreements interact with the SDGs.<br><br>
