Welcome back to our online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>

In this module, we begin a discussion of trade and sustainable growth. Sustainability has more than one dimension. In this module, we address environmental issues, with a particular focus on climate change.<br><br>
The subject matter of trade and the goal of environmental sustainability is very broad. To keep it focused, we will address mainly the question of whether trade makes the tasks of maintaining a healthy environment and dealing with climate change effects easier or more difficult.<br><br> 

The module will also introduce concepts such as sustainable growth and sustainable trade. We will show how trade can be used as a channel to achieve sustainable growth. We will then discuss evidence highlighting the circumstances that facilitate or impede this process. Our main focus is on the environmental Sustainable Development Goals, which include Clean water and sanitation; Affordable and clean energy; Sustainable cities and communities; Climate Action, Life below water, and Life on land.<br><br>
Trade facilitates economic growth as well as specialization. Growth increases emissions, including those of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. Policies are needed because there is no market for the effects of climate change or of the emissions that contribute to it. Externalities of this kind require policy actions if emissions are to be kept to socially optimal levels.<br><br>
Climate change, along with measures aimed at mitigation of its effects or adaptation to them, has effects not only on total income and wellbeing but also on the distribution of changes in each. So the question of “who bears the cost” is relevant in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are oriented toward poverty reduction and inclusive growth.<br><br>
In particular, we want to know whether solutions to the climate change issue will raise or lower the costs and the likelihood of success in reaching the wide variety of Sustainable Development Goal targets<br><br>
