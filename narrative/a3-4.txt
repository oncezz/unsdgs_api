This module has provided an overview of issues relevant to the links between trade and the environmental SDGs. In later modules, we return to environment and sustainability several times. We will also go into more detail on some issues—most notably, the interactions between trade, climate change effects— that have implications for non-environmental SDGs such as poverty reduction and inclusive growth.<br><br>
