While trade can empower consumers’ choices for responsible consumption and production, it also comes with some unwanted sid e effects.<br><br>
As seen in earlier modules, trade creates more economic activity, which in turn leads to more pollution and natural resource consumption. This is what we described earlier as scale effects.<br><br>
Lower trade costs also encourage supply chain fragmentation into several countries. Intermediate goods then have to travel from several places before they reach the final consumers.<br><br>
The more fragmented supply chain also makes it harder to monitor environmental compliance at every production point.<br><br>
 Lastly, at the end of the products’ lives, they might be discarded in developing countries with weaker environmental regulations.<br><br>
This figure shows the global value chain of the hazelnut cocoa spread brand Nutella. Each green circle shows the supplier of an ingredient. Each red triangle shows a factory's location, and each purple cross shows a main sales office location. We can see that this single product uses hazelnut from Turkey, palm oil from Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Brazil, cocoa from Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and Ecuador, and vanilla flavor from the US and Europe. Such diversity in the ingredients' origins can cause challenges in tracing and monitoring the sustainability of each ingredient. Moreover, all of those ingredients have to travel to factories and then to sales points on different continents. We will see in the next slide that this may cause more greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>
This graph shows the percentage of domestic origin in total carbon dioxide emissions embodied in the final demand of five countries from 1995 to 2011. These five countries were the biggest sources of carbon dioxide released in 2011. We can see that this domestic percentage declines over time, which means that larger shares of carbon dioxide emissions come from imported goods.<br><br>
According to a recent study, the global energy footprint has increased by 29.4% from 1995 to 2009.<br><br>
 By decomposing the sources of such increase, the researchers found that the global value chain has caused the energy footprint to increase by 7.5% or about a quarter of the total increase.<br><br>
Finally, international trade may also create an opportunity to dispose of products irresponsibly. This graph shows the net export of plastic waste and scrap. We can see that developed countries are net exporters of plastic wastes, and developing countries, on the whole, are net importers. China used to be the biggest importer of those wastes until January 2018, when it banned all plastic waste imports. Following the ban, some parts of those plastic wastes have been diverted to South-East Asian countries such as Viet Nam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. These countries generally have limited capacity to handle and process such wastes, and some of them are therefore disposed of inappropriately.
