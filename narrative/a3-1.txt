Welcome back to our online course, Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br> 
This is the third of four introductory modules, titled Trade and Environment.<br><br>
The environmental Sustainable Development Goals set out goals and specific targets for clean water and sanitation, affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, climate action, life below water, and life on land.<br><br>
Trade influences the pattern of production and input use.<br><br>
In this module, we provide an overview of environmental issues related to trade.<br><br>
This in turn has an impact on the allocation and use of natural resources, as well as on the production of pollution and toxic wastes. Some effects of trade are measured in terms of their contribution to emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, affecting global climate change.<br><br>
We begin by decomposing the effects of trade on the environment into three parts.<br><br>
We will then also consider interactions with institutions and policies, including the role of trade agreements.<br><br>
Questions about the interaction of trade and the environment are paramount in the developing world. Many poorer countries rely heavily on their natural resource wealth to generate income and earn foreign currency to purchase needed imports. Moreover, trade is associated with increased economic activity. Other things equal, this means more demands on the natural resource base—on water supplies, productive land, and fisheries—and also more pollution. So questions about the links between trade and all kinds of environmental damage are central to sustainable development.<br><br>
In this module, we break down the ways in which trade affects environmental incentives and practices. Trade increases incomes and also the value of some environmental assets, which can create incentives to manage and preserve them for the future.<br><br>
But we will also see that in many cases, trade can potentially impede progress toward some environmental SDG targets.<br><br>
This is especially true when institutions that regulate resource access and use, for example, the rule of law or well-defined property rights, work imperfectly or not at all.<br><br>
These institutional constraints on behavior are especially important because environmental changes often involve externalities or other forms of market failure, as discussed in the previous module.
