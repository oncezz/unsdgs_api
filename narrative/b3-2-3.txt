Putting the pieces together, we can now see that trade - by adding to productivity growth in a variety of ways - has the potential to greatly lower the cost of achieving some key Sustainable Development Goal targets. In particular, trade helps achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 9's targets of raising the industry's share of gross domestic product and promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization. However, the latter goal also depends on the nature of innovation and the distribution of gains from trade.<br><br> 

Causation may also run in the other direction: investments in Sustainable Development Goal targets such as health, nutrition, education, labor mobility, infrastructure, and a competitive business environment all enhance trade, thus creating a virtuous circle of growth and poverty reduction.<br><br>
More open trade raises productivity through several channels. In output markets, shown in the first row of this table, where the firm is a seller, import competition means firms must improve productivity in order to compete with foreign firms. At the same time, they have both opportunities and incentives to enter or expand in export markets. The latter might also be a result of foreign liberalization, such as a free trade agreement or GSP concessions.<br><br> 

Row 2 shows what happens in input markets, where the firm is a buyer. In input markets, access to imported intermediates means lower production costs. Foreign input competition means foreign firms increase competition with domestic firms supplying the same inputs. We already saw in Module B.1.3 how lower tariffs on imported intermediate goods played a role in the growth of the Bangladesh ready-made garment industry. Lower imported intermediate costs due to tariff reduction are found to be a major source of productivity growth in many studies. For example, the study of Indonesian manufacturing firms by Amiti and Konings was also discussed in Module B.1.3.<br><br> 

All of these effects cause firms to increase the efficiency of their production or to reduce their production costs, so raising total factor productivity.<br><br>
Examples of more open trade increasing competition in domestic markets are easy to find. They are especially obvious when economies move from near-autarkic policies to more open trade.  In 1990, German reunification opened the former East German economy to official trade outside the Soviet bloc. Production of the Trabant, an East German family car that was notorious for its high cost and terrible performance, went to zero in the same year. Many of the resources used to produce it in East Germany, such as the main factory, equipment, and parts of the labor force, were then repurposed for the production of Volkswagen, a West German car.<br><br>
We also know that exporting rewards more productive firms because they are more able to compete in global markets. Exporting also makes them even more productive, as they learn from and respond to international competition. The expansion of more productive firms takes place in part at the expense of less productive firms, as their best workers are hired away, and they lose contracts to competitors. This movement of resources means that, on average, productivity across industries rises with trade. Global Value Chain participation is an important vehicle for this process, both because it increases the integration of firms with the global economy and because it intensifies the kinds of competition that lead to productivity gains.<br><br>
We also see productivity growth as the result of a broader resource reallocation among sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing.<br><br. 
Empirical decompositions show that sectoral reallocation dominates other sources of productivity growth in Thailand and Indonesia. During Thailand's so-called miracle years from 1980 to 1996, total factor productivity growth averaged about 2% per year and contributed about 1/5 of total income growth.<br><br>
Other empirical research establishes a clear link between trade liberalization and total factor productivity growth in Thailand. But there's more: as trade policy becomes more open, this increase in efficiency, productivity, and competitiveness also attracts more investment. So a large part of the total increase in that country's aggregate capital stock during the miracle years was induced by trade opening. This has been confirmed in counterfactual analyses in a study by Diao et al. in the Journal of Development Economics.<br><br>
During its economic growth miracle, Thailand’s trade-to-GDP ratio increased by a factor of three. During the same interval, the average for all middle-income countries also increased, but at a lower rate.<br><br> 

Over the same years, the share of industry in Thailand’s economy rose by one-third, and that of agriculture decreased by almost two-thirds—much faster rates of change than for the average middle-income economy.<br><br>

Employment by sector changed almost equally rapidly in Thailand. Wages in the industry sector remained much higher than in the agriculture sector, indicating greater labor productivity in the industry sector than in the agriculture sector. In the early 1990s, GDP per worker in the industry sector was about $8700 in the 2010 prices or roughly 7.5 times higher than in the agriculture sector.<br><br>
There was persistently greater labor productivity in the industry sector than in the agriculture sector. In the early 1990s, GDP per worker in Thailand's industry reached $10,000 in 2010 prices, roughly 9 times higher than in agriculture. On average, each worker transferring from an agriculture job to an industry job increased their productivity by about this amount. Notice that this productivity growth is unrelated to changes in the labor force other than the sector of employment. That is, the gains from investment in education and other forms of human capital are additional to these gains.<br><br>

During Thailand's "miracle" years, exports to GDP expanded very rapidly, and total factor productivity growth averaged about 2% per year or about 1/5 of the total GDP growth.<br><br>
