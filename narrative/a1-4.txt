Let me summarize. In this module, we have gone through a quick survey of links between trade and the SDGs. Overall, we discussed that:<br><br>
The potential for total income gains from trade has important implications for the SDGs.<br><br>
Among the SDGs, the most direct linkages may be to the “social and economic” goals. Goals 1-5 are those with the greatest and most immediate impacts on human well-being. Throughout this course we will give special attention to outcomes relevant to these goals.<br><br> 
As we shall see, trade can also help a country work toward targets associated with environmental SDGs. But here, impacts are frequently less obvious, often indirect, and almost always harder to measure.<br><br>
And income effects are not the only forces at work: structural changes also matter a lot.<br><br> 
In all cases, the benefits of trade are conditional on institutions and policies that promote or facilitate equitable and sustainable outcomes. When the right conditions are present, trade can greatly lower the cost of achieving many sustainable development goals.<br><br>
Trade policy and policies directly addressing SDGs are likely to interact, creating opportunities for synergies—or additional economic costs as tradeoffs to achieve sustainable development.<br><br>
