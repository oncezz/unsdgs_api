The Bangladesh experience is mostly a positive one, but not all countries have similar stories. Why not? Among many reasons, the three shown here are especially important. In the remainder of this module, we generate some insights relevant to these three points.<br><br>
But we also challenge you to think about these in relation to a particular country. For example, what are some examples in which institutional strengths or weaknesses might have played a role in total growth gains from trade or in the distribution of those gains?<br><br>
In evaluating trade and growth, it's important to remember that many gains from trade are the result of one-time changes. For example, tariffs can only be lowered to zero, and the economic benefits of reducing tariffs diminish as the rates get lower. Correspondingly, reallocating labour and other resources in response to the new pattern of production creates a one-time efficiency gain - unless something else also changes.<br><br>
The "something else" that changes - are additional responses that alter potential productivity growth, mobilize new resources, or induce investments in human capital improvements. These do not take place automatically: they require policies and institutions that encourage investments, entrepreneurial risk-taking, and the sharing of knowledge. If they succeed, then we see dynamic gains from trade. If the complementary conditions are absent, the total gains from trade are limited.<br><br> 

The distinction is important because countries that cannot capture dynamic gains risk falling into a slow-growth trap - or sometimes called the middle-income trap.<br><br>
We noted at the start of this module that the services share of GDP tends to grow faster than total GDP as countries become more wealthy. Historically, services seldom entered directly into trade (a few, like international transport services, were exceptions). But that doesn't mean they are unaffected by trade opening. Bernard Hoekman at the OECD summarizes some clear connections.<br><br>
 
Services make up half or more of GDP and employment in every country. So the dynamism of the services sector has a very big role to play in ensuring that growth gains are widely distributed. In the 21st century, services enter into trade both directly—for example, in the form of IT services— and also indirectly, for example, embodied in traded manufactured goods. However, efforts to increase trade in services often encounter barriers in the form of non-trade policies such as data flow restrictions, limits on migration, and discrimination in favour of national entities.<br><br> 

Domestic trade policies are clearly important; for example, lower tariffs on vehicles reduce transport costs. But increasingly, international trade deals are also targeting services, with the effect that domestic monopolies in areas like banking, insurance, finance, and telecoms are being diminished, almost always to the benefit of domestic consumers.<br><br>
Finally, it bears reiteration one more time that trade alone is no panacea for poverty, inequality, or slow economic growth. The gains from trade can only be fully realized if domestic institutions support the rule of law, property rights, dispute resolution, and other preconditions for business activity and investment to thrive. Once again, overall growth and inclusive growth are two targets, and in most cases, the use of just one instrument, say, trade opening, will be insufficient to ensure both that targets are reached.<br><br>
