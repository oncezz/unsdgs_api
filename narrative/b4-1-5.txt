To wrap up this module, we have seen that trade goes hand-in-hand with institutions, and they both lead to economic growth. We have also discussed the role of the World Trade Organization in building the multilateral trading system that comes along with several measures to assist developing countries. Ideally, we hope to see multilateral trade liberalization going forward and bringing free and fair trade among all the member countries. However, the WTO has run into several roadblocks in recent years, and that brings several countries to the second-best option of bilateral and regional trade agreements. The expansion in both breadth and depth of these agreements can help align the trade policy goals with other sustainable development goals. However, the disparity in capacity and bargaining power between developed and developing countries might limit the gains of the latter.<br><br>
