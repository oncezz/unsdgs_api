There is a strong consensus that avoiding the so-called “Middle-Income Trap” requires investments in human capital— specifically increases in the cognitive skills, capabilities, and entrepreneurial flair needed to lift an economy into increasingly sophisticated modes of production and technology use. Does trade advance this goal? That is, does trade lower the cost of successfully attaining the targets of Sustainable Development Goal 4, “Quality education”?<br><br> 

It is notable that in Sustainable Development Goal 4, nearly all targets are directed at increasing or improving the supply of educational services. Trade, on the other hand, mainly affects the demand for education. It does so through two key channels: it alters household incomes, and it induces structural changes in the economy that change the returns to educational investments or the so-called “skill premium.”<br><br>
Income effects are quite easy to understand. When households are poor, education is less affordable. If schooling is not free, or if child labor (for example, on a family farm or in a family business) helps to add to household income, then the opportunity cost of sending children to school can be a decisive influence in household decision-making.<br><br>
Sustainable Development Goal 8 targets an end to child labor in all its forms. Trade can influence this through income effects. If trade raises household incomes, then other things equal, families will tend to keep their children out of the labor force and in school for longer. On the other hand, if trade alters labor demand in ways that increase the value of children’s work, then in the absence of institutional or other measures to prevent it, child labor may increase. We will discuss this topic in more detail later, in Module B.3.1.<br><br>
