Sometimes productivity growth is conflated with domestic efforts at innovation through R&D. Direct innovation, for example, through successful R&D discoveries, contributes to productivity growth. Still, as we have seen in the cases of Thailand and Indonesia, it’s not the only source of productivity growth nor even the primary one. As these figures show, different countries pursue different strategies, resulting in different mixes of home-grown and imported innovation.<br><br>
Some amount of domestic R&D is optimal. But the costs of establishing an effective research system are very high, and resources to build and maintain it must be diverted from other purposes.<br><br>

Trade enables firms to acquire innovations developed abroad without undertaking all the fixed costs and risks of home-grown R&D. This means that resources, such as retained profits and government spending, can be put to other uses. This is another way in which international engagement can increase total factor productivity and make domestic firms more competitive.<br><br>

The economist Richard Baldwin talks about the difference between building an industrial supply chain and joining an established one. Early industrializers like Japan and Korea were forced to construct their own industrial supply chains, including R&D, which required huge investments of scarce fiscal and human capital resources. In the 21st century, emerging economies have the option to join existing regional or global supply chains without incurring all the fixed costs. Clearly, this is a big advantage in terms of efficiency and potential for economic growth.<br><br>
Sustainable Development Goal 9 includes, among its targets, the aim to “Enhance scientific research, upgrade the technological capabilities of industrial sectors in all countries, in particular developing countries.”<br><br>

Trade can potentially help countries to reach this target in a more cost-effective manner by providing some of the enabling conditions—notably, cheaper intermediate inputs that increase firm productivity and may increase the returns to their R&D investments.<br><br> 

On the other hand, trade also provides substitutes for domestic R&D through licensing and through technologies bundled with FDI. Their availability reduces the need for domestic R&D investments where international substitutes exist.<br><br>
However, there are some clear motivations for building domestic R&D infrastructure - especially in agriculture, where local conditions demand adaptive research to optimize productivity. In addition, domestic R&D capacity may be complementary with productive use of imported advanced technologies and also with incentives for young people to acquire higher-level skills and credentials.<br><br>
