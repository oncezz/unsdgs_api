Welcome back to our online course: Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br>

This is the second of two modules on sustainability. “Sustainability” is not only about the environment and natural resources. In this module, we turn attention to the challenge of sustaining growth in the long run.<br><br>
The particular focus in this module is on the contribution of trade to human capital accumulation and the transmission of gains from growth and development to the next generation. These are two essential elements in efforts to escape the so-called “middle-income trap.”<br><br>
A consensus in empirical growth studies is that the “middle-income trap” is due in large part to a failure to anticipate the investments required to help an economy transition from low-skill, low-wage production to more sophisticated and complex activities. Among these investments, education is perhaps the most important of all. Does trade influence educational investments, and if so, how?<br><br>
Later in the module, we turn attention to another form of the long-run growth problem, that of transmitting the gains—and those of inclusive growth—to future generations. We ask how international trade might affect this process.<br><br>
