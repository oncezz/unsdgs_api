We saw in Module A.1 that over the past 70 years, world trade had expanded much faster than world GDP. Both overall growth and the expansion of trade have contributed to rapid increases in demand for natural resources. Moreover, increases in overall economic activity have added significantly to emissions of air and water pollution as well as solid waste. Among these emissions, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions have accelerated global warming and climate change at an unprecedented rate. The environmental SDGs set out many targets for localized action to reduce these environmental costs of economic growth.<br><br>
In studying the environmental effects of trade, it is helpful to break the total impacts down into three component effects. Scale effects are linked directly to economic activity, while composition and technique effects are linked to structural changes that occur as the result of trade and development. To see these, let’s consider just one environmental issue, that of greenhouse gasses emissions.<br><br>
Understanding scale effects is very straightforward. If the economy increases in size and nothing else changes, then emissions (and other environmental damages) will simply increase at the same rate as GDP growth.<br><br>
As a result, more economic activity will mean more pollution, more greenhouse gases emissions, and more natural resource depletion.<br><br>
Scale effects can also be understood at the sectoral or industry level: if trade stimulates an increase in production from a particular industry and nothing else changes, then emissions from that industry will increase in proportion to output. We can see this in the case of topic deforestation in the next slide.<br><br>
Land use and land-use change contribute significantly to global greenhouse gases emissions. In total, almost one-quarter of greenhouse gases emissions come from these sources.<br><br>
A few tropical countries, among them Brazil and Indonesia, contribute a large share of total emissions from agriculture and land-use change.<br><br>
 As they exploit their comparative advantage in tropical agriculture, their emissions from land-use change increase roughly in proportion to increased area planted. The expansion of these sectors is a scale effect that stands in sharp contrast to the goal of SDG 13, to combat climate change.<br><br>
In Indonesia, one crop, in particular, is responsible for a very large share of present-day land-use change, that is, oil palm. Indonesia and Malaysia jointly supply nearly 90% of the world’s palm oil exports. Area expansion has been dramatically rapid, especially in Indonesia. Most of the new land farmed to oil palm is produced from forests, typically through burning.  As a result of the booming global demand for palm oil and its derivatives, Indonesia’s palm oil sector, by expanding, produces massive amounts of greenhouse gases released. In just one six-month period in 2015, the average carbon release was estimated at 11.3 m tonnes per day, 26% more than is released daily by the entire European Union.<br><br>
The total economic benefits of trade are measured by efficiency gains as a country pursues its comparative advantage. But we must also ask how changing the production mix alters the overall intensity of emissions and other forms of pollution.<br><br>
 A country with a comparative advantage in a relatively “clean” industry will see emissions intensity decline as it specializes relative to its trading partners.<br><br>
Conversely, a country with a comparative advantage in relatively “dirty” industries will see emissions intensity increase. These changes are in addition to scale effects, as just discussed.<br><br>
The idea that a country might specialize in ‘dirty’ activities because it has a comparative advantage in those sectors is sometimes called the “pollution haven effect.”<br><br>
But it is important that the increase in pollution can only occur if institutions and/or policies are accommodating of more pollution-intensive behaviors.<br><br>
The third component of trade-related changes in environmental outcomes is known collectively as “technique effects.” These are changes in the intensity of emissions (or natural resource use) per dollar of income generated due to changes either in production technology or in consumption patterns.<br><br>
If trade incentivizes investment in new capital stocks, these are likely to embody newer, more efficient, and possibly cleaner production methods than the older vintages of capital that they replace.<br><br>
Thus, unlike the scale effect, this effect of trade is associated with diminished emissions per dollar of income.<br><br>
One example of the supply-side technique effect comes from China’s efforts to upgrade its power generation infrastructure. China is very heavily dependent on coal-fired power plants for electricity generation. The numbers and capacity of these plants have increased greatly during China’s economic miracle. But newer vintages of power plants embody significant improvements in efficiency, so less coal is burned to produce each unit of electricity. The newer plants also burn cleaner, releasing fewer harmful emissions per unit of power generated. The composition of China’s coal fleet has moved sharply toward supercritical and ultra-supercritical technologies, which are much cleaner than the subcritical technologies of older generations.<br><br> 
This change in technique is not a cure for China’s greenhouse gases emissions, which remain the largest in the world. But for so long as they continue to burn coal to produce electricity, it is, at least, a step in the right direction.<br><br>
Demand-side technique effects also matter. As consumer incomes rise, so too does willingness to pay for a clean environment and other amenities, including preservation of natural landscapes and threatened species of animal and plant life. (Although these are typically called “technique effects,” they are more clearly understood as “preference shifts” on the part of consumers).<br><br>
As trade increases average incomes, more consumers become willing to change their consumption patterns or make other sacrifices in order to achieve a cleaner environment.<br><br>
These preference shifts reduce the effort and cost required to make progress toward goals like SDG 13, which targets greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Policies for a clean environment also become easier to pass and implement. These trends exemplify the principle of increasing opportunity cost, or “low-hanging fruit,” as introduced in the previous module.<br><br>
Summing up, the effects of trade on the environment break down into three components. Scale effects always increase emissions and other forms of environmental harm when an economy is growing.<br><br>
Technique effects always reduce the intensity of emissions or other damages due to updates in capital vintages or changing consumer preferences.<br><br>
 And composition effects could go either way, depending on a country’s comparative advantage and pattern of trade.
