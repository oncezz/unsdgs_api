Food security is a first-level policy challenge for many low-income countries. In this module, we discuss issues surrounding food security and the strategy by some countries to restrict trade to achieve this. We will critically assess this strategy conceptually before highlighting that importing food is not (necessarily) a problem. This module will focus on the first and the second Sustainable Development Goals: ending poverty and ending hunger.<br><br>
SDG 2, ending hunger,  includes among its targets to “End hunger and ensure access by all people… to safe, nutritious and sufficient food all year round”, and to “Correct and prevent trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets.” The focus of the latter target is on “agricultural export subsidies and all export measures with equivalent effect.” Global food markets are certainly vulnerable to disruption from export incentives in food-exporting countries. But for food-deficit countries, we will argue that it is their own restrictions on food imports that pose the greatest threat to food security.<br><br>
In this module, we focus on the distinction between food security and food self-sufficiency and evaluate evidence on the links between food trade (notably, food imports to net deficit countries) and food security. We also consider a positive role for self-sufficiency policies, one that runs through agricultural productivity rather than through trade restrictions.<br><br>
The global definition of food security has four key elements.<br><br>
The first one is availability. This element addresses food production, stocks, and net trade. However, adequate supply does not alone ensure food security.<br><br>
The second element is food access. This one addresses effective demand by consumers. Food can be accessed through the market as well as through non-market means and is strongly influenced by price as well as by consumers’ purchasing power, which is, in turn, a function of income, employment, and other elements. These demand-side elements link food security and poverty reduction.<br><br>
The third dimension is food utilization, which refers to the effective uses of food consumed. This aspect of food security is determined mainly by individual health status and so links food security to health, which is addressed in the Sustainable Development Goal 3, and sanitation, which is in the Sustainable Development Goal 6.<br><br>
Finally, stability emphasizes the need for food security to be a persistent condition at all times. Volatility in incomes, prices, and physical availability all pose potential threats to the stability of the food supply.<br><br>
Food markets, even in the absence of policy measures, have some features that are uncommon by comparison with the markets for most other goods. These are due to the nature of food supply and demand.<br><br>
Food supply is special in part because agricultural production is subject to unanticipated shocks, for example, from the weather.<br><br>
On the consumer side, food demand is highly inelastic with respect to price; that is, the quantity demanded doesn’t change much with the price. Also, food’s budget share is unusually large in poor households but is much lower in higher-income households.<br><br>
Also, food’s budget share is unusually large in poor households but is much lower in higher-income households.<br><br>
It is also very important to be aware that not all food producers or farmers are net suppliers of food to the market.<br><br>
Poor farmers, who have little productive land under their control, make up a large fraction of the farm population in most developing countries and a majority in some.<br><br>
Because they have few assets, they are net consumers of staple foods.<br><br>
As such, and unlike larger farmers who are net sellers of food, poor farmers are generally made better off by low food prices and worse off by high food prices.<br><br>
Moving from autarky to trade induces food price changes. In net exporting countries, trade means a larger market and more elastic demand for their products. In net importing countries, trade means more abundant (and more stable) supply and lower food budget costs. On average, changes are likely to benefit both types of countries.<br><br>
However, the average change in a country disguises important and relevant variation, as we shall now examine.<br><br>
In reality, every country’s population has a mix of net consumers and net producers. An increase in food prices will increase the real incomes of net producer households and reduce those of net consumer households. Households of both types may live close to the headcount poverty line. Therefore, whether headcount poverty rises or falls as a result of the food price change depends on how many households move in each direction.<br><br>
This graph shows a simulation by economists Maros Ivanic and Will martin in their working paper in 2014. It simulates the changes in percentage points of people living below the $1.25 per day poverty line when food prices increase by 10 percent. The rise in food prices increases poverty in India, Pakistan, and Indonesia but reduces poverty in Cambodia, China, and Viet Nam.
