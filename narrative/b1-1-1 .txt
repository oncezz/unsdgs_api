Welcome back to our online course - Trade and the Sustainable Development Goals.<br><br> 
This is the first of our intermediate modules titled Trade, Poverty, and Inequality.<br><br>
In this module, we discuss the conceptual mechanisms by which trade affects poverty and inequality and summarize empirical evidence on the two. This module focuses mainly on the economic SDGs, especially the goals to reduce poverty and the call for decent work and economic growth while also reducing inequalities, that is, SDGs 1, 8, and 10.<br><br>
How do trade and FDI affect poverty, labour, and inequality?<br><br> 
We begin with a review of anti-poverty policies and show how trade interacts with these.<br><br>
We pay special attention to the role of the labour market because trade affects this directly and because changes in wages and employment, in turn, have direct effects on incomes and poverty.<br><br> 
We touch on foreign direct investment because this is a key element in job creation.<br><br> 
Finally, we discuss the role that complementary policies may have in allowing the growth-related effects of trade to be channelled toward equitable growth.<br><br>
