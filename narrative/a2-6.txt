In this module, we have built a conceptual framework to explore links from trade to economic SDGs.<br><br>
We can see that the links to social and environmental SDGs are less direct and often ambiguous.<br><br>
In the next introductory module, we will turn our attention to a survey of trade and the environmental SDGs.<br><br> 
Following that, in the final introductory module, we will look at some of the policy issues, especially international agreements governing trade and their implications for the social SDGs.<br><br>
Thank you for your attention today!<br><br>
Please test your new knowledge by taking the short quiz that follows this slide.<br><br> 
After that, you will find a more formal treatment of the basic economics of trade and well-being. This is more advanced material for those who choose to pursue it. Of course, other descriptions of the trade-economy relationship can be found in abundance with an internet search.
